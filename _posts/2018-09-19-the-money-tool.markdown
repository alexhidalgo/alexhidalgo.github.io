## Many of us including myself have been confused lately. So allow me to clear that up. 
<br />
Politics are a mess — like they have always been, avocados are edible bowls if you take out the seed and money is a tool. A straight up tool. Like an extra wrench in a tool bucket that you periodically use to solve problems that matter today or very soon in the future. Problems like, fix your brand new toilet that's now leaking all over your house. That wrench wasn’t really important until now. It's great if you have it handy and if you don’t then you’re up shit creek.

The point is we need to stop thinking of money as something more than a tool. It just isn’t. And if you do then it's exactly like if you had some weird fetish for owning a bunch of wrenches that you don't need right now. Instead maybe you should give them away to people that actually need a wrench or two.
